# Garden Hose ðŸª´
This was the second and final project I worked on in my Internet Applications class.<br>

The assignment was to create a responsive retail website with six webpages. After working on my first project, there were many improvements I wanted to make in my approach to CSS for this project, and assuring it was responsive added another challenge. I knew that I wanted the website to have a gardening theme, but it took me a while to come up with the name, which usually helps me unravel the rest of the theme, as creating the logo gives me the foundation I will use for the color scheme. With the help of my brother, shopping at Home Depot, and some friends, I gathered inspiration that led to the final product. I did attempt to create a working shopping cart with JavaScript; however, programming isn't really my strong suit, so I put that mini-project on pause. I hope to find resources to help me learn JavaScript and grow my knowledge of Full-Stack Web Development.
